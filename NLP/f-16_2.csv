Oct-80,F-16A,"The aircraft crash landed on Rogers dry lake bed at Edwards AFB due to a blown nose gear tire on take off during the annual open house air show. It was shipped to General Dynamics Fort Worth in a C-5 and rebuilt into the first F-16XL, flying back to Edwards one year later on December 2nd, 1981. The pilot survived unharmed but very shaken.",0
Unknown,F-16A Block 1," 	
Suffered a mishap on landing. The nose gear would not come down. The pilot tried everything to get it down, no luck. It was decided he would land on the runway and keep his nose up as long as he could. There was some concern the external wing tanks would drag so of course the crash trucks were there in case of fire. The pilot brought the plane in very slowly and landed on the mains, kept the nose up and almost came to a stop before the nose dropped. The radome was of course scraped up, the ring around the intake and the lower tacan antenna was gone. The wing tanks were about 5-6 inches from the ground. It was found out the seals in the nose gear were almost totally deteriorated. It was the original nose gear from the factory. Everything that was damaged was replaced and the plane was flying three days later.",0
Nov-89,F-16A Block 1,Engine turbine failed during a take-off roll sending pieces of the turbine blades through the fuel cell. Pilot aborted take off after seeing the fire light and shut down the engine. After the pilot opened the canopy and jumped out found the entire tail of the F-16 on fire. The aircraft was sent to depot but was never repaired.,0

Oct-79,F-16A Block 1,"Crashed in Nevada due to an engine problem. An MOT&E aircraft piloted by Paul R. was lost as it ran out of flight control authority. The pilot was simply rocking the wings at low altitiude to acknowledge an F-15 simulated attack over Nellis range. The flight control limitations were not fully known or understood by engineers and pilots in those early days, and the triple ejection racks (TERs) loaded on stations 3 & 7 disrupted airflow over the wings causing loss of control at low altitude. Paul ejected successfully and due to his zoomie training at the academy and was able to steer himself clear of the fireball without injury.",0

Ran off the runway at Salt Lake City International Airport caused by a main gen/CSD failure. Had extensive damage to the right wing and fuselage. The wing was replaced from a block 10 aircraft. An interesting note to this repair is that the fuselage was reassembled on wooden cradles, with no precision alignment. The misalignment was discovered when the boresight was accomplished after repair, the fuselage was ""twisted"" to the right approx .250"" from the F.S. 189 bulkhead forward. The gun and HUD mounts had to be moved .250"" to compensate. It actually turned out to be the 466th TFS's best bomber after that.",0
Mar-80,F-16A Block 5,"Destroyed in a fire due to an engine failure that sent some turbine parts through the main fuel cells. The pilot, D.W. Bell, was from the Operational, Test & Evaluation squadron but using 388th TFW aircraft ejected safely after trying to restart the engine. The fact that the aircraft did not blow up was a relief to some early pilots as they were not convinced that the new designed fuel cells would perform as advertised. The fuel cells are sealed partitions in the fuselage. However, the major concern was about the fly by wire flight control system and what happened if the power was totally lost if the flight controls went ""stupid"". It was well understood that loss of flight controls could cause 20 Gs in less than a quarter of a second.",0

Had a mid-air collision with F-16A (#78-0045) near Wendover, Utah. The pilot, Major Tom Ward, ejected safely.",0
Mar-82,F-16A Block 5,"In Lt. Col. Pat ""Gums"" McAdoo's words:

""I was the first Viper pilot to successfully land the thing with a failed leading edge flap. Was early spring/late winter 1982. Maybe 20 March, tail number 044, as that log entry shows 0.3 hours and a precision approach. Weather was not ll that keen. Have the HUD video in VHS format.""

""Maintenance troops had failed to insert a 'keeper' bolt that is supposed to keep the flap drive tubes from slipping apart. It's like a cotter key on a bolt. The flap drive motor has a spline gear on it and the drive tube has gear teeth that match up. So the drive tube gradually slipped out from the motor spline gear. When I rotated, the drive tube slid all the way out and the leading edge flap went up until the wing upper surface stopped it. Maybe 50-60 degrees. Another troop had his fail a few months later and the flap went to 90 degrees because he was going a lot faster when the drive tube failed. So I was at 160 knots and holding full left stick. Post-flight data revealed that I had about one pound of control authority for banking left. So I was holding 15-16 pounds of left stick the whole time. ""

""I stayed at 170-180 knots, as I could still maintain control and wasn't gonna play Chuck Yeager more than I had to. Nevertheless, I was the first troop to fly the thing in that configuration, so everything was new territory. Bunted over to get opposite flap 2 degrees up and locked the flaps( LEF's go up when bunting over, or when weight is on wheels). I now had both LEF's up, and it seemed to help with the roll authority. Additionally, that other flap wasn't gonna be moving all over the place, and this kept things a little more predictable. ""

""Came around on the ILS and landed in one helluva crab. The drag was so great that I almost landed short when I pulled off the power. As I was coming in a lot hotter than normal, I thought I would land long. heh heh, sucker dropped like a rock and I was able to make a mid-field turn off.""",0

Crashed in the Utah Test & Training Range, killing the pilot, Captain J. Edgington Moats at 14:54 hours. All USAF F-16's were grounded two days later. It was the F-16's second grounding. Cause of accident was a malfunctioning bleed air valve which allowed bleed air to leak out onto the EPU, causing an electrical surge that shut down the flight control computer. The pilot initiated ejection, but was too late.",1
Jan-82,F-16A Block 5,"Impacted the ground east of the Nellis AFB, Nevada. The F-16 was part of a two-ship and both were coming from Hill AFB to bring spare parts. The unit was on a TDY to Nellis at the time of the mishap. 78-0048 landed first and the aircraft was on a normal landing approach. On touchdown the main landing gear collapsed. This was supposed to be impossible but it happened. Probable cause was that the gear was not fully down. The centerline fuel tank exploded on contact with the runway. The pilot selected full afterburner and managed to get the aircraft airborne again. The pilots logic would be that the entire ramp at Nellis was packed with aircraft and that he didn't want his disabled aircraft to slide off the runway and cause a major accident. The pilot climbed to approximately 500 feet, trailing about a 100 feet of flames, banked the aircraft left towards the desert, leveled out and ejected. There was a cheer from everyone who witnessed the accident when the pilots' chute opened. As an additional note: The Thunderbirds had been practicing just moments before the accident. Every practice is videotaped. They missed capturing the entire event on film by just a few moments. Also as a bit of irony: the spare parts were being carried by the aircraft that crashed.",0
Feb-86,F-16A Block 5," 	
	
Flew into the Gulf of Mexico with the pilot, Captain Larry Edward Lee, being killed. The accident happened during the early AMRAAM program. While flying over the Gulf of Mexico at approximately 2500 ft and Mach 1.5, the pilot was performing 9G wind up turns to stress the aircraft and weapon system. The engine exploded and departed the aircraft through the backbone. Capt. Lee ejected at over Mach 1 breaking both arms causing him to drown. The aircraft was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico where it was inspected to determine the cause of the accident.",1

Aug-79,F-16B Block 1,"F-16 write-off number one. The aircraft was written off in a crash while on approach to Hill AFB, Utah. The pilot at the controls was a Belgian pilot on the OT&E team. The pilot had refueled and forgot to close the aerial refueling door. Therefore, he could not get gas from his external tanks, which were de-pressurized for the refueling. Worse, the B-model lowered flaps when refueling to provide increased clearance between the boom and the canopy. So he couldn't get external fuel (had two big external tanks) and if he slowed down the flaps extended. He had plenty of internal gas originally, but apparently failed to monitor the actual amount of internal fuel and suddenly the 'low fuel' light came on! His 'total' fuel was way up, but all the gas in the external tanks was unusable due to no pressurization. He had to manually select the tanks of interest, otherwise what you saw on the gauge was 'total' fuel. The pilot tries for Hill AFB and slows to best range speed, slow enough for the trailing flaps to come down and increasing drag/fuel consumption. The F-16 flames out on downwind and the pilot tries for a deadstick landing, unfortunately he couldn't make it and punches out really low. The now pilot-less plane actually made it to the runway overrun and pancakes but was a total lost.",0

Suffered a mid-air collision with AT-38B 62-3746 which were both photo chasing B-1B 84-0049 for a weapons separation test. The AT-38B crashed with both on board being killed. The F-16 landed safely with damage to the left wingtip.",0
Jul-80,F-16B Block 1,"Impacted the ground on the Eagle range, Utah. The crew, Capt. Don Stuart and Capt. Larry Danner, ejected safely and were uninjured. During the second low angle bomb pass on the Eagle Range target, the engine stagnated when the throttle was advanced from idle following bomb release. Airspeed was traded for altitude, but both the primary and backup control airstart attempts were unsuccessful and they bailed out at about 1500 feet. The subsequent investigation revealed an alignment pin was missing from a critical valve in the engine compressor variable geometry system which precluded restart.",0

The pilot, Major Aaron George and Lockheed photographer Judson Brohmer were killed. Incident occurred at 7:00 hours about 30 miles east of China Lake. The F-16 was flying a photo/safety chase position on a 2nd F-16 on a test mission to demonstrate reliability improvements on a MALD (Miniature Air Launch Decoy). Following the launch of the MALD, the MALD's engine failed. The MALD descended at a 20 degree angle until 8,996 feet where a drogue shoot deployed followed by a recovery parachute at 7,000 feet. It drifted into mountainous terrain. The mishap aircraft was collecting video coverage of the MALD's launch, recovery, and landing. In order to maintain optimum position for video taping the MALD, the pilot had to execute barrel roll maneuvers to avoid passing the MALD. As the MALD's drogue shoot deployed, the mishap pilot executed a 3rd barrel roll maneuver, to maintain position which placed him at a steep, inverted, high speed dive that he was unable to recover. The crash was caused by channelized attention on the MALD and loss of altitude awareness.",1

At 1:09 local time the main generator warning light came on and the EPU started. The pilot Major John Cary who was part of a four ship flight advised of his emergency and tried to make it to Buckley ANGB. After flying in for five minutes on the EPU, that failed and flight controls were lost. Major Cary ejected at 1000 feet with a 90 degree nose down near Elizabeth, Colorado. Injuries were sore neck, chipped tooth and swollen eye which resulted in temporary blindness. This was caused by the high negative G's the aircraft pulled (-6G during a pitch down). The reason for the failure was due to an EPU overspeed which caused an over voltage to the flight control computer causing it to shut down.",0

Unknown,F-16A Block 10A,"This USAF F-16 crashed twice, but was repaired both times - hence it got named 'Twice as Nice'. It was later sold to Israel. The first crash was in 1984 - sometimes when aircraft systems designers integrate various components into an airframe, they forget to examine what happens if a component should fail. Such was the case in the original F-16 design. An electrical connector (cannon plug) came loose and unfortunately the wiring for critical components like brakes and arrestor hook all went through the same connector. The pilot attempted to land the aircraft and engage the arrestor wires. Both wires were missed and the aircraft went off the end of the runway. The pilot stayed with the aircraft and the rescue crews had to cut through the canopy to reach hime - the hole in the canopy can be seen in the photo. After this accident they changed the electrical schematic and wiring harness so that those features went through different connectors now. The second crash occurred a few years later. Cause of mishap was a stuck throttle cable at 70% power. The incident happened at MacDill and the pilot landed the aircraft then ejected when he couldn't stop it. It then went off the end of the runway.",0

Oct-90,F-16C Block 25,"Suffered a structural failure during a flight test (flutter tests) from Eglin AFB, Florida. The test was to assess the structural integrity of the F-16 while carrying a load of 6 AMRAAM's. The aircraft was flying inverted at 2,000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico with an airspeed of Mach 1.2. The pilot noticed a serious problem with the aircraft and rolled it back to level flight, but experienced a very hard time to keep it levelled. The left flaperon was sticking up like a sharp fin in the airflow and rudder was also missing from the aircraft. The pilot, Captain Joseph A. Lanni, gained control of the aircraft and checked its controllability. Captain Lanni brought the aircraft back to Eglin AFB with no further problems, mainly because he was already lined up with the runway and the fact that the chase-plane (F-4) pilot kept telling him to stick with it. The pilot had to keep 25 lbs of constant pressure to the stick to keep the aircraft straight. The aircraft was repaired afterwards. Maintainers believe the rudder imploded from delamination since they never found a piece of it anywhere. The jet tried to kill the same pilot 3 more times after this event - 2 sudden decompressions at altitude and when the right flaperon did the same thing, only this time tore off and smashed into the stabilator.

Early reports said the pilot ejected, this turned out not to be the case as images from the scene show the canopy still in place. Early reports also incorrectly reported that the aircraft tookoff and returned to Luke AFB with an emergency landing. Excerpt from the crash report: ""After being cleared for takeoff, Colonel Sherman taxied to the left side of the runway accompanied by Captain Cuadra on the right side. Upon ignition of the afterburner, Colonel Sherman heard an explosion and noticed that a fire had started on his aircraft. His wingman transmitted ""Fire"" on the radio and Colonel Sherman applied full brakes and initiated the appropriate critical action procedures to abort the takeoff due to fire and preparing to get out of the stopped, but burning aircraft. He was able to open the canopy and safely exit the F-16. Members of the Luke AFB fire department extinguished the aircraft fire"".

Jun-03,F-16C Block 40B,"Collided on the ground with F-16C (88-0516) caused by a hydraulic failure. The incident happened at just before 8:00 am local time on the Zulu-1 taxiway of Al Udeid AB, Qatar. Initial unconfirmed reports indicate that a taxiing F-16 lost all hydraulic power and ran into a parked F-16 at about 10 knots. One maintenance troop on top of the parked F-16 was thrown or jumped off the F-16 and was slightly injured, abrasions to his back. Both F-16s were fully loaded with live ordnance, there were also 3 pieces of AGE equipment involved. After the impact, some sort of electrical short is suspected from one of the AIM-9 missiles, that possible ignited some of the fuel and started a fire in the motor of the AIM-9 and on a below mounted avionic pod. This fire was reportedly quit large and it was extinguished by another maintenance troop, possible saving 7 fully loaded F-16s! As the Fire Department arrived on scene there was light smoke but no fire. The rocket motor was still smoldering so about 200 gallons of water was used to cool them down. After it was determined that there we no lives at stake the area was evacuated. EOD made entry about 45 minutes later. They determined that a piece of AGE equipment that was lodged between the two aircraft would need to be stabilized with a crane during the download of the munitions. This effort totaled 6 hours and 33 minutes with the outside temperatures being between 110F and 133F during the emergency. EOD removed 4 damaged munitions and one that they were unsure of.",0

Three days prior to the accident the engine was installed by SSgt Al Lynch, SSgt Stewart Baily, SSGT Jim Biggs, Sgt Paula Forness, AIC Jerrod Whittaker and AIC Jason Wollever. After several delays, the aircraft was launched by SSGT Scott Ramsour. The aircraft taxied and went to EOR arm crew. On take-off the engine lost power and the pilot climbed to MSA to bring the aircraft back to the base. The aircraft made an emergency landing attempt and struck the approach overrun area 100 yards short of the runway on the right side. The main landing failed and the aircraft collapsed along with the nose landing gear. The aircraft came to rest between the taxiway and runway after sliding 1,500 feet. The pilot raised the canopy electrically and tried to climb out but couldn't since his G-suite hose was still connected. He was burned and recieved injuries to his back and spine but did survive after being rescued by the fire brigade. The pilot, Captain Mark A. Merkel, was initialy rescued by passing personel. The cause of the accident was determined to be a faulty augmentor fan control unit (AFT).",0

A US Army HH-60 Black Hawk rescued him. The 388th Fighter Wing cancelled all flying for two days. The cause of the crash was due to a missing combustion diffuser pressure seal in the engine. Lack of parts forced the rebuild of the engine to take seven months. Proper daily maintenance logs were not kept to show what work had been preformed. The overheated engine caused it to seize, and no chance for a restart. The aircraft had flown for almost eighteen months without the seal before the crash.",0

Struck by lightning during a sand storm while deployed for OSW. Was the lead aircraft of a two ship formation at an altitude of 35,000 to 40,000 feet when the wall of sand surrounded the aircraft and there was nowhere to go but through the storm. When the lightning strike occurred, the airspeed dropped to zero and the aircraft fell into a flat spint in the orange sand sky. Fortunately the pilot recovered but bottomed out at an altitude of only 500 feet.
Chris, the Crew Chief of #377 describes the experience: ""We got the squacks saying my jet was code three for a lightning strike and the other was code one. That was strange to me because there really wasn't too much lightning out there and I had never seen a jet get struck by lightning. Anyway when the jet came in 15-20 minutes later, I noticed immediately something wrong, the ECM pod nose cone was gone! I hooked up the comm cord and said to the pilot like I always do ""How are you doing Sir' did you have a good flight?"" The only words out of his mouth were ""I almost died, your jet saved me, if you could get me out as fast as you can."" So as normal I shut him down, and it wasn't till I got a closer look that I noticed all kinds of things wrong; all of the leading edge tape was gone, the static dischargers broke off, the electronic nose cones of the cluster bombs he was carrying were gone and because it was our squadron jet, all the probes that I had polished were sandblasted After that we had nothing but problems, a standby generator problem which ended up being the harness through the 341 bulkhead, a FLCS problem which was a harness in the right strake and a few flights later tension strut bushing problems that are still going on to this day.""",0

That resulted in sparks starting a fire. The aircraft was taken apart and shipped back in March 2005 to Mountain Home AFB and repaired by a team from Hill AFB. By July 2005 the aircraft was finally repaired and after a few test flights and scheduled upgrades was back in service. Mishap was graded a class A but was later downgraded to a class B. The aircraft was flown back to the United States aboard a C-5.",0

Went down in mountainous forest near the city of Kamaishshi, in the northern part of Japan. The crash occurred at 13:30 hours and 85 miles south of Misawa AB. The aircraft was on a training mission. Cause of the crash was human error. A malfunctioning G-suit distracted the pilot who gave it an inspection. The aircraft at the time was 418 at only 3,300 feet. When the pilot returned his attention to flying, he found a wind screen full of the terrane of a ridge. He pulled back on the stick, but flew straight through the trees on the ridge. The cut was 85 feet long, 35 feet wide and just 20 feet above the ground. Forty-five seconds after hitting the trees, the pilot ejected safely.",0

Lost during takeoff from Balad AB, Iraq at 16.55 hours with the pilot managing to eject safely. Accident investigation found that the nose gear tire was at low pressure and maintenance failed to properly check the tire pressure. During takeoff roll the nose gear tire blew when the aircraft reached 150 mph. Pilot heard the pop and thought it was an engine failure so aborted the take-off even though at high speed and running out of runway. Shortly after the nose gear collapsed and due to sever lack of control the pilot (also a commander) elected to eject. Aircraft continued another 2000 feet until it went off the runway where it tumbled end-over-end coming to rest upside down. Fire erupted and the 20mm rounds cooked off.",0

The aircraft crashed at 11:29 am at about 1.6 miles northeast of the town of Tanosawa, Japan. The pilot, Maj. Chad Miller, ejected from the aircraft with minor injuries. Approximately 15 minutes after beginning a qualification training upgrade mission, Miller reported an engine problem. He immediately turned toward land and attempted to restart the engine four times without success. He turned the aircraft parallel to the coast away from populated areas and then ejected. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact with the water. Based on evidence obtained during the investigation, the accident investigation board president's opinion is that a fatigue crack had developed in a high-pressure turbine blade. The crack caused a portion of the blade to fall off that then caused catastrophic damage and failure of the remaining turbine blades. Once the turbines failed, the engine could no longer produce thrust, continue to operate or be restarted. ",0
Mar-05,F-16D Block 52P,Crashed at the end of the runway at 8:34am while attemtping to land at Nellis AFB. The pilot ejected safely but was taken to the hospital to be treated for scratches. A briefcase got loose on the back-seat and jammed the throttle making it unable for the pilot to shut down the afterburner. The accident happened because the pilot failed to comply with emergency procedures.,0

Impacted the ground coming out of a loop at the Kingsville air show in Texas. The aircraft was from Shaw AFB, South Carolina. Pilot, Major Brison Phillips, did not eject. Six minutes into the scripted airshow the pilot executed a double Immelman maneuver to 21 seconds inverted followed by a split S maneuver. The inverted maneuver was standard to maintain position with ground references and the show line. Due to strong winds and unfamiliar ground references, the pilot channelized his atention on the ground references and the show line but not at his power setting en 12 dive angle. Higher than normal power and the dive caused him to descend rapidly from 6,300 feet to 4,200 feet and accelerate from 132 knots to 444 knots. The pilot recognized this and pulled maximum G's but impacted the ground",1

Commander of the 55th Fighter Squadron ejected from this F-16 at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Harvey survived the ejection which occurred about 15:00 hours. The pilot ejected under a minute after takeoff. Cause of the crash was due to engine fuel control problems from a faulty AC generator which gave wrong signals to the Digital Engine Control (DEC). Just after the pilot left the aircraft, the engine regained power and flew for an additional thirty seconds before impacting the ground two miles from the end of the runway.",0

At around 17:40 hours - while on a two ship training mission over the Atlantic, 30 miles off the coast of South Carolina - this F-16 went down. The other pilot in the flight saw the ejection and a parachute open but it was not untill 19:35 hours that the pilot, Captain Theodore 'Ted' Shultz, was rescued by the US Coast Guard. The cause of the crash was determined to be a G-LOC incidence.",0
